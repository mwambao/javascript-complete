/*
Practice exercise 4.1
1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.
2. Output the value of the variable to the console.
3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console,
using the following syntax:
if(myVariable){
//action
}
4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether
the condition is not true, and create a message that will be printed to the
console in that instance. You should have two if statements, one with an
! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement
insteadâ€”experiment!
5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes.
