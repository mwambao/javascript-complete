You can add event listeners to elements to handle user interactions.
we have user some events like onclick for buttons, others are like onmouseoer, onchange etc

There is a way to register event handlers using JavaScript as well. We call these event
listeners. Using event listeners, we can add multiple events to one element. This way,
JavaScript is constantly checking, or listening, for certain events to the elements on
the page. Adding event listeners is a two-step process:
1. Select the element you want to add an event to
2. Use the addEventListener("event", function) syntax to add the event
Even though it is two steps, it can be done in one line of code:

document.getElementById("square").addEventListener("click",
changeColor);

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Events listeners on elements</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Button element that users can click -->
    <button id="myButton">Click me!</button>
</body>
<script>
    // Selects the button element by its ID and stores it in the 'button' variable
    let button = document.getElementById("myButton");
    
    // Adds an event listener to the button for "click" events,
    // calling the 'buttonClicked' function when the button is clicked
    button.addEventListener("click", buttonClicked);
    
    // Function that runs when the button is clicked, displaying an alert message
    function buttonClicked(){
        alert("Button clicked!");
    }
</script>
</html>
