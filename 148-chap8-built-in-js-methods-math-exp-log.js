/*
The exponent is the number to which a base is being raised. We use e (Euler's
number) a lot in mathematics, this is what the exp() method in JavaScript does. It
returns the number to which e must be raised to get the input. We can use the exp()
built-in method of Math to calculate the exponent, and the log() method to calculate
the natural logarithm.

let exp = Math.exp(x);
console.log(exp); // 7.38905609893065

let log = Math.log(exp);
console.log(log); //2
