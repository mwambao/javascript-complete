<!--
Our aim is to change the background color of the element on the page as the various mouse events occur. 
* On mousedown over the element, the element will turn green.
* When the mouse is over the element, it will turn red. 
* As the mouse moves out of the element boundaries, the color will turn yellow. 
* When the mouse is clicked, the color will go green, 
* and when the mouse is released, it will change to blue. The actions also be logged in the console.

1. Create a blank element on the page and assign a class to it.
2. Select the element using its class name.
3. Assign a variable to the element object from the page.
4. Update the content of the element to say hello world.
5. Using the style properties of the element, update the height and width, then
add a default background color to it.
6. Create a function to handle two arguments, the first being a color value as a
string and the second being the event object of the trigger.
7. In the function, output the color value to the console, and for the event,
output the event type to the console.
8. Add event listeners to the element: mousedown, mouseover, mouseout, and
mouseup. For each of these events, send two arguments to the function that
you created: a color value and the event object.
9. Run the code and try it in your browser.
