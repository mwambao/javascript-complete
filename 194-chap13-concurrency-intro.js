/*
* concurency -> happening at same time / in parallel. we can do an API call and not wait for the reply but do something useful in the meantime instead.
            -> three statergies while working with concurency in JS: callbacks, promises and async and await

i - callbacks -> A function taking another function as an argument.
ii - promises -> A promise is a special object that connects code that needs to produce a result and the code that needs to use this result in the next step.
iii - async / await -> async: we mak a function return a promise, await: to wait until the promise is done.

* Event loop -> The event loop in JavaScript is like a waiter in a restaurant who takes orders, delivers food, and keeps checking if new tasks need to be handled.
