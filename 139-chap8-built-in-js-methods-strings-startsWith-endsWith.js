//sometimes you want to check what a string starts or ends with.

let encouragement = "You are doing great, keep up the good work";

//true since the string beginds with 'You'
console.log(encouragement.startsWith("You")); // true

//false since the string doesnt end with 'good'
console.log(encouragement.endsWith("good")); // false
