<!--
Using a basic HTML file, the below exercise will demonstrate the order of loading for
the window object and the document object using DOMContentLoaded, which is an event
that fires once the document object content is loaded in the browser. The window
object will load afterward, even if the window.onload statement comes first.

1. Within a basic HTML file, create a function named message that requires two
parameters, the first one being a string value for the message and the second
an event object. Within the function, output into the console using console.
log the event and the message.

2. Using the window object, attach an onload function to the event object. Invoke
the function, passing a string value of Window Ready and the event object to
the message function for output.

3. Create a second function to capture the DOM content loading, and add an
event listener listening for DOMContentLoaded to the document object. Once
that event is triggered, pass the event object and a string value of Document
Ready to the message output function.

4. Change the order of the event listeners, placing the document event statement
prior to the window onload: does it make a difference in the output?

5. Using the document object, add the DOMContentLoaded event listener, which
will send to the function the arguments of Document Ready and the event
object that was triggered.

6. Run the script and see which event is triggered first; change the order of the
events to see if the output sequence changes.

<!--
This code displays two different console messages:

1. When the DOM content (HTML structure) is fully loaded (DOMContentLoaded).
2. When all page resources (like images, styles) are fully loaded (window.onload).

Each message includes the event information for debugging or further processing.
