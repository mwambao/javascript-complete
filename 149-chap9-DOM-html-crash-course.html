<!--
* The Document Object Model (DOM) is a lot more exciting than it may sound
at first. This is a fundamental concept you will need to understand before working with JavaScript on web pages. It grabs an HTML page and turns it into a logical tree.

* The Browser Object Model (BOM) holds all the methods and properties for JavaScript to interact with the browser. This is information related to previous pages visited, the size of the window of the browser, and also the DOM. sometimes called windows browser object.

=> To see BOM right-click on page -> inspect -> console -> console.dir(window); click on triangle to inspect the information about windows object
e.g. document properties under the listing
=> To see list of properties of an object: console.dir() for example console.dir(alert)

* The DOM contains the HTML elements on the web page. With JavaScript, we can
select and manipulate parts of the DOM. This leads to interactive web pages instead
of static ones. So, long story short, being able to work with the DOM means you're
able to create interactive web pages!

* HTML code consists of elements. These elements contain a tag and attributes.
