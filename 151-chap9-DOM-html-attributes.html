- Attributes influence the element they are specified on. They exist inside the element
they are specified on and are assigned a value using an equal sign. For example, the
attribute of a (which indicates a hyperlink) is the href. This specifies where the link is
redirecting to:
<a href="https://google.com">Ask Google</a>

- This displays a link with the text Ask Google. And when you click it, you will be sent
to Google, which can be told by the value of the href attribute. This modifies the a
element. There are many attributes out there, but for now you just need to know that
they modify the element they are specified on.
- Most important attributes that we need to use:
