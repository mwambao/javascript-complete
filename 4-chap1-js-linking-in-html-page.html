    <!--This is considered a better
practice, as it organizes code better and you can avoid very lengthy HTML pages
due to the JavaScript. In addition to these benefits, you can reuse the JavaScript on
other web pages of your website without having to copy and paste. Say that you
have the same JavaScript on 10 pages and you need to make a change to the script.
You would only have to change one file if you did it in the way we are showing you
in this example.-->
