Often, it is not desirable to provide direct access to our properties. We want our class
to be in control of the values of properties for several reasonsâ€”perhaps we want to
do validation on a property to assure it has a certain value.

This is how to add properties that aren't accessible from outside. We prefix them
with a # symbol:
*/

class Person {
    #firstname;
    #lastname;

    constructor(firstname, lastname) {
        this.#firstname = firstname;
        this.#lastname = lastname;
    }
}

//we will get undefined for the properties as we are trying to access properties from outside. We can enable this access using setters and getters.
let p = new Person("Duncan", "Owino");
console.log(p.firstname + ' ' + p.lastname ); // undefined undefined
