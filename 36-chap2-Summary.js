/* 
In this chapter, we dealt with the first two programming building blocks: variables and operators. 
    >Variables are special fields that have a name and contain values. 
    We declare a variable by using one of the special variable-defining words: let, var, or const.
    Variables enable us to make our scripts dynamic, store values, access them later, and change them later. 
    > We discussed some primitive data types, including strings, numbers, Booleans, and Symbols, as well as more abstract types such as undefined and null. 
    > You learned how to determine the type of a variable using the typeof word. 
    > And you saw how you can convert the data type by using the built-in JavaScript methods Number(), String(), and Boolean().
    > Then we moved on and discussed operators. Operators enable us to work with our variables. 
    They can be used to perform calculations, compare variables, and more.
    >The operators we discussed included arithmetic operators, assignment operators,comparison operators, and logical operators.
    >After this chapter, you are ready to deal with more complex data types, such as arrays and objects. We'll cover these in the next chapter.
