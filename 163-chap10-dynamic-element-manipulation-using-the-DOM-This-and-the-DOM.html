<!--
'this' keyword always has a relative meaning; it depends on the exact context
it is in. In the DOM, the special this keyword refers to the element of the DOM it
belongs to. If we specify an onclick to send this in as an argument, it will send in
the element the onclick is in.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>This and the DOM</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button onclick="reveal(this)">Click here!</button>
</body>
<script>
    function reveal(el){
        console.log(el);
        // This will print: <button onclick="reveal(this)">Click here!</button>
        console.log(el.innerText);
        //This will print: Click 
    }
</script>
</html>

<!--
So, the this keyword is referring to the element, and from this element we can
traverse the DOM like we just learned. This can be very useful, for example, when
you need to get the value of an input box. If you send this, then you can read and
modify the properties of the element that triggered the function.
