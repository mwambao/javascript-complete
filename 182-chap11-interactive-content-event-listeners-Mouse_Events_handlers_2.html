<!-- NOTE
This allows for a lot of interaction. You can do so many things with this. Just to give you an example of a thing you can do, say you want to have a very dynamic,  mouseover-driven, product-help decision tool. It will consist of four columns, and the content of the last three columns (from the right) is dynamic content. The first column is for categories. The second column contains some more specific product
categories for each category. The third column consists of individual products, and the fourth column shows product information. This requires a lot of event listeners, and lots of deletion and addition of listeners.
